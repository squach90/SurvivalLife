# SurvivalLife

Hello my nickname is squach90 and I have been making video game for 1 years.

It's my second "Real" video game, it doesn't have a goal yet but it won't be long ...

I titled it "SurvivalLife" (the name is temporary).

You can walk around, explore the map eat, drink and more with beautiful images and a low poly theme !

I managed to make this game thanks to the tutorials of "Tuto Unity FR"; https://youtube.com/@TUTOUNITYFR?feature=shares 

How to Install

1. To launch the game you must download the version that interest you .

2. Once the download is complete, open the folder and double-click on   «SurvivalLife.exe » 

3. The game opens and it's your turn to play
